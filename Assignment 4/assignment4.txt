Assignment 4  (programming)
Submission date 30 September 2011

1) In the main program define an array, H, of integers of size 1000
which will be used to implement a heap. Define a global variable "heapSize"
to denote the entries in $H$ (so size will increase by 1 on insertion
and decrease by 1 on MaxDeletion).

Ask the user for a positive integer n less than 1000. Then read n integers 
from the user and insert it in H, as a heap. Then do MaxDelete n times
and print the deleted entry each time.

Note that this will output the integers sorted in decreasing order.

2) Write 
void InsertHeap(int x){....}
which inserts integer x and updates the variable heapSize.

3) Write
int MaxDelete(){....}
which MaxDeletes the heap, returns the deleted integer, and 
updates the variable heapSize.

4) Write
void PrintArray(){.....}
which just prints the content of the array H from H[1] to H[heapSize].

Note this routine will be used only for grading purpose.
